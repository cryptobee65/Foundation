# CryptoHives .NET Foundation

Welcome to the **CryptoHives .NET Foundation** documentation!

## Overview

The CryptoHives .NET Foundation provides libraries for .NET applications focusing on memory management and threading primitives.

## Available Packages

### 💾 [Memory Package](packages/memory/index.md)

The Memory package provides allocation-efficient buffer management utilities that leverage `ArrayPool<T>` and modern .NET memory APIs to minimize garbage collection pressure for transformation pipelines and cryptographic workloads.

**Key Features:**
- `ArrayPoolMemoryStream` and `ArrayPoolBufferWriter<T>` classes backed by `ArrayPool<byte>.Shared`
- Lifetime managed `ReadOnlySequence<byte>` support with pooled storage
- `ReadOnlySequenceMemoryStream` to stream from `ReadOnlySequence<byte>`
- `ObjectPool` backed resource management helpers

### 🔄 [Threading Package](packages/threading/index.md)

The Threading package provides high-performance async synchronization primitives optimized for low allocation and high throughput scenarios.

**Key Features:**
- All waiters implemented as `ValueTask`-based synchronization primitives with zero memory allocation design
- Implementations use `IValueTaskSource<T>` based classes backed by `ObjectPool<T>` to avoid allocations by recycling waiter objects
- Async mutual exclusion with `AsyncLock` and scoped locking via `IDisposable` pattern
- `AsyncAutoResetEvent` and `AsyncManualResetEvent` complementing existing implementations which are `Task` based
- Minimal allocation design for hot-path code
- Fast path optimizations for uncontended scenarios

1. [Install the packages](getting-started.md#installation)
3. [Browse the API documentation](api/index.md)

## Sample Code

### Memory Example

```csharp
using CryptoHives.Foundation.Memory.Buffers;
using System.Buffers;

// Use ArrayPoolMemoryStream for low-allocation I/O
using var stream = new ArrayPoolMemoryStream();
await stream.WriteAsync(data);

// Get zero-copy access to the data until stream is disposed
ReadOnlySequence<byte> sequence = stream.GetReadOnlySequence();
```

### Threading Example

```csharp
using CryptoHives.Foundation.Threading.Async.Pooled;

// Pooled async lock reduces allocations
private readonly AsyncLock _lock = new AsyncLock();

public async Task DoWorkAsync()
{
    using (await _lock.LockAsync())
    {
        // Protected critical section
    }
}
```
