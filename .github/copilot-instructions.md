# Copilot Instructions for CryptoHives .NET Foundation

## Purpose

This file documents how GitHub Copilot (or any automated editing agent) should add or modify code in this repository while following the project coding style and conventions.

## Repository Overview

The CryptoHives Open Source Initiative develops secure high-performance .NET libraries and tools for cryptography workloads and transformation pipelines.

**Repository Characteristics:**
- **Size:** Medium-scale codebase with less than 10 C# projects
- **Language:** C# with .NET 8.0/9.0 target framework, legacy .NET Standard 2.0/2.1 and .NET Framework 4.6.2/4.8 support
- **Architecture:** Modular design with projects for memory management, threading, and security
- **Type:** High-performance security focused class libraries and console applications
- **License:** MIT License

## General rules

- Make only high confidence suggestions when reviewing code changes.
- Always use the latest version C#, currently C# 13 features.
- Never change global.json unless explicitly asked to.
- Never change package.json or package-lock.json files unless explicitly asked to.
- Never change NuGet.Config files unless explicitly asked to.
- Always trim trailing whitespace, and do not have whitespace on otherwise empty lines.
- Always preserve the SPDX file header found at the top of source files. Example: `// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2025 The Keepers of the CryptoHives` followed by `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`.
- Follow the existing file layout: preprocessor directives (e.g. `#if ...`) come first, then the `namespace` declaration, then `using` directives. Keep a single blank line between these regions as in existing files.
- Use `namespace` declarations that match the file path. For example, files under `src/Threading/Async` use `namespace CryptoHives.Foundation.Threading.Async;`.
- Use PascalCase for public types and members, camelCase for local variables, and `_underscore` prefix for private fields (example: `_mutex`).
- Add XML documentation (`/// <summary>...`) for public types and public members following existing style and punctuation.
- Use XML remarks for properties and methods which may need explanation.
- Use XML `<param>` and `<returns>` tags for public methods.
- Use XML `<exception>` tags for public methods which may throw exceptions.
- Use XML `<code>` snippets for code examples.
- Add only XML `<inheritdoc/>` tags when overriding or implementing interface members.
- Keep methods short and focused. Prefer small helper methods when needed.
- Prefer `ValueTask` over `Task` for low-allocation hot-path async primitives when the project already uses `ValueTask` (see `Pooled.Async*` types).
- Use `Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool` and the existing pool policy types when adding pooled objects.
- Follow the project pattern for multi-targeting: code may include `#if` guards for framework-specific APIs (see `ReadOnlySequenceMemoryStream` for `NET8_0_OR_GREATER` checks).

## Formatting and ordering

- Follow all code-formatting and naming conventions defined in [`.editorconfig`](/.editorconfig).
- Keep `using` directives after the `namespace` (this repository places them inside the namespace block). Use one blank line between `using` groups and top-level members.
- Keep `private readonly` fields declared at the top of the type, before constructors.
- Place public constructors and properties before private helpers when possible.

## Testing conventions

- Tests use NUnit. Test classes live under `tests/*` with corresponding project names which end in `.Tests`. File names end in `UnitTests.cs` or `Benchmark.cs`.
- Use `[TestFixture]` on classes and `[Test]` or `[Theory]` on methods. Async tests should return `Task` and use `async/await`.
- Follow existing test helpers and patterns (for example `AsyncAssert` helper used in other tests). Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code where appropriate; tests often call it when awaiting.
- Name tests clearly to describe behavior (example: `WaitAsyncUnsetIsNotCompleted`).
- Do not use underscores in test method names.
- Prefer adding new tests to existing test files when possible.
- Do not add comments in test code that with Act/Arrange/Assert sections unless necessary for clarity.

## Safety checks before committing

- Run a build: `dotnet build` or use existing CI commands. Ensure no compilation warnings or errors were introduced.
- Run unit tests locally if appropriate: `dotnet test` for the relevant test project.
- Keep changes minimal and follow the repository patterns. If introducing an API surface change, add or update unit tests to cover the behavior.

When in doubt

- Search for a similar implementation in the repository and copy the style and structure used there (e.g., `AsyncAutoResetEvent`, `ReadOnlySequenceMemoryStream`).
- Prefer consistency with existing code over personal preference.

Contact

- If the change is non-trivial or touches public API, open an issue or PR and request review from repository maintainers.
