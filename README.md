## 🧬 Features and Design Principles

### 🧱 Orthogonal Design
- All development is done on free and open-source tools, e.g. .NET SDK, Visual Studio Community Edition, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc.
- Each package is designed to be orthogonal and composable with other CryptoHives packages to avoid deep cross dependencies
- Dependencies on other packages are kept to a minimum and shall only include widely adopted, well-maintained libraries, e.g. the Microsoft.Extensions
- OS and hardware dependencies are avoided wherever possible to ensure deterministic behavior across all platforms and runtimes, specifically for security implementations
- There is no intention to replace or shadow existing .NET class libraries; instead, CryptoHives packages are designed to complement and extend existing functionality

### ⚡ High-Performance Primitives
- CryptoHives provides a growing set of utilities designed to optimize high performance transformation pipelines and cryptography workloads.

### 🛠️ Memory Efficiency
- **ArrayPool-based allocators** for common crypto and serialization scenarios
- Pooled implementations of `MemoryStream` and `IBufferWriter<T>` for transformation pipelines
- Primitives to handle ownership of pooled buffers using `ReadOnlySequence<T>` and `ArrayPool<T>`
- Zero-copy, zero-allocation design for high-frequency cryptographic workloads and transformation pipelines

### 🚀 Concurrency Tools
- Lightweight Async-compatible synchronization primitives based on `ObjectPool` and `ValueTask<T>`
- High-performance threading helpers designed to reduce allocations of `Task` and `TaskCompletionSource<T>`

### 🧪 Tests and Benchmarks
- Comprehensive tests and benchmarks are available to evaluate performance across various scenarios.

### 🔐 Clean-Room Cryptography (planned)
- Fully managed implementations of symmetric and asymmetric algorithms
- No dependency on OS or hardware cryptographic APIs
- Deterministic behavior across all platforms and runtimes
- Support for both classical and modern primitives (AES, ChaCha20, SHA-2/3, etc.)

### 🔒 Fuzzed APIs (planned)
- All libraries and public-facing APIs are planned to be fuzzed

## 🧩 Installation

Install via NuGet CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package CryptoHives.Foundation.Threading
```

Or using the Visual Studio Package Manager:

```powershell
Install-Package CryptoHives.Foundation.Threading
```

---

## 🧠 Usage Examples

---

Here’s a minimal example using the `CryptoHives.Foundation.Memory` package:

```csharp
using CryptoHives.Foundation.Memory;
using System;

public class ExampleWriter
{
    public string WritePooledChunk(ReadOnlySpan<byte> chunk)
    {
        // Use a MemoryStream backed by ArrayPool<byte> buffers
        using var writer = new ArrayPoolMemoryStream();

        writer.Write(chunk);
        ReadOnlySequence<byte> sequence = writer.GetReadOnlySequence();
        return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(sequence);
    }
}
```

---

Here’s a minimal example using the `CryptoHives.Foundation.Threading` package:

```csharp
using CryptoHives.Foundation.Threading.Async.Pooled;
using System;

public class Example
{
    private AsyncLock _lock = new AsyncLock(); 

    public async Task AccessSharedResourceAsync()
    {
        // Due to the use of ValueTask and ObjectPools, 
        // this mutex is very fast and allocation free
        // Acquire the lock asynchronously
        using await _lock.ConfigureAwait(false);
        // Access shared async resource here
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Clean-Room Policy

All code within the **CryptoHives .NET Foundation** is written and validated under **strict clean-room conditions**:

- No reverse engineering or derived code from existing proprietary libraries
- Implementations are verified against public specifications and test vectors  
- Review process includes formal algorithm validation and peer verification  

---

## 🔐 Security Policy

Security is our top priority.

If you discover a vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue.**  
Instead, please follow the guidelines on the [CryptoHives Open Source Initiative Security Page](https://github.com/CryptoHives/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
